This project works with visualizations and analysis on the dataset 'Real Breast Cancer Data' from www.kaggle.com [1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/breastcancerdataset/discussion?resource=download&fbclid=IwAR0XJfeVbma_2KhCVVmfCBzy2i7bya_TTCP7LWwK-8PWMkE1watNLZyu3wg). \\ The analysis and visualizations are written in Tidyverse R.

Furthermore, the repository is linked to a shiny-app repository handling the same dataset, but for dynamic visualizations with user inputs.

## Operation

To run the project, run the /project/R/00_doit.R script, which will run the relevant files and generate results in the /project/results/ folder.
